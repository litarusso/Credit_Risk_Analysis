# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose of The Analysis
We applied two machine learning analysis to evaluate credit card list. We used a credit card dataset, data was oversampled and undersampled. We compared two oversampling algorithms to determine which algorithm results in the best performance.

To do this, we followed steps below:  
- "Naive Random Oversampling" scores, 
- "Smooth Oversampling" scores,
- "Undersampling" scores, 
- "Combination of Oversampling and Undersampling" scores,
- "Balanced Random Forest Classifier" scores,
- "Easy Ensemble Ada Boost Classifier" scores.

## Results

The related scores of the six machine learning models are below:

- Naive Random Oversampling Scores:
  - Balanced accuracy score:0.655,
  - Precision: 0.99
  - Recall: 0.61
  - F1: 0.75
