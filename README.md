# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Purpose of The Analysis
We applied two machine learning analysis to evaluate credit card list.We used a credit card dataset, data was oversampled and undersampled.
To do this, we followed folowing steps:  
- "Naive Random Oversampling" scores, 
- "Smooth Oversampling" scores,
- Undersampling scores, 
- "Combination of Oversampling and Undersampling" scores,
- "Balanced Random Forest Classifier" scores,
- "Easy Ensemble Ada Boost Classifier" scores.
